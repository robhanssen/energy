Duke Energy is kind enough to give out 30-minute interval data of my electricity use in "easy to read" XML files. These scripts read the data from XML into CSV and do some analysis.

Source files:
energyusage20210726.xml: data from 2019-06-25 UTC to 2021-07-25 23:30:00 UTC
energyusage20211026.xml: data from 2019-09-25 UTC to 2021-10-25 23:30:00 UTC

Care should be taken to not delete the oldest file and to not create gaps.
